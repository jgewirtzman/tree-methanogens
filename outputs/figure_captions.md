(b) Tree stem CH~4~ flux (nmol m^-2^ s^-1^) measured across three sites during 2021 and 2023 campaigns. Points show individual flux measurements at 125 cm stem height; lines and shaded bands show mean flux and standard error by site. (c) Soil temperature (top) and volumetric water content (bottom) measured continuously at each site over the study period. All three panels share a common x-axis representing time (panels b and c) or VWC (panel a). Data from the Yale Myers Forest long-term monitoring network.

Predicted metabolic pathways associated with mcrA abundance in tree wood.** Heatmap of MetaCyc pathway abundances predicted by PICRUSt2, showing pathways significantly associated with mcrA gene abundance (FDR < 0.01) after excluding contributions from mcrA-containing OTUs. Samples (columns) are ordered by mcrA abundance (low to high); pathways (rows) are clustered by similarity. Top annotation bars indicate log~10~(mcrA) abundance and wood compartment (Heartwood vs. Sapwood). Color scale represents row-scaled relative abundance (blue = low, red = high). Statistical associations determined by linear mixed-effects models with sample identity as a random effect, controlling for compartment type and total 16S concentration.

**Figure S7. Internal CH~4~ concentrations by tree species.** Beeswarm plot showing the distribution of internal stem CH~4~ concentrations for 16 tree species, ordered by mean concentration (highest at top). Points are colored by internal O~2~ concentration (blue = low O~2~, red = high O~2~; scale 5-22%). Black points with horizontal bars show species mean +/- standard error. X-axis uses a pseudo-log~10~ scale with mixed labeling (ppm for values < 1%, % for values >= 1%). Species span four orders of magnitude in median CH~4~ concentration.

**Figure S9. Stable carbon isotopic composition of tree stem CH~4~.** Distribution of delta^13^CH~4~ values (per mil VPDB) measured from internal tree stem gas samples. Top: kernel density estimate showing bimodal distribution. Bottom: individual measurements as jittered points. Dashed vertical line indicates atmospheric CH~4~ isotopic signature (~-47 per mil). Bracket annotations show literature ranges for three methanogenic pathways: hydrogenotrophic (~-110 to -60 per mil), acetoclastic (~-65 to -50 per mil), and methylotrophic (~-70 to -50 per mil). The distribution of values spanning and exceeding these ranges suggests multiple methanogenic pathways contribute to tree stem CH~4~ production.

**Figure S14. Independence of methanogen and methanotroph gene abundances.** (a) Individual tree-level mcrA vs. total methanotroph (pmoA + mmoX) gene abundance (log~10~-transformed), showing no significant correlation (r = 0.095, p = 0.299). (b) Species-level median mcrA vs. median methanotroph abundance, also showing no significant correlation (r = -0.154, p = 0.672). The lack of correlation supports treating mcrA and methanotroph abundances as independent predictors of CH~4~ flux.
